# Redux-Store

## Description

This application have been refactored from a global state application that I worked before using React's **Context API** https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html to a **Redux** https://redux.js.org/.  I needed to read redux documentation to follow guidelines to accomplish this process succesfully. 

## Usage

* Please deploy application at Heroku,
* Users are able to click app name (Shop-Shop) and open a list of products for sale whit their own descriptions,
* Users would be able to sign up to and checkout products that where already selected in shopping cart,
* Once you push checkout button, you will be able to fill out credit cart information having at same time a list of your products together with their descriptions.
* After it you will see a success message that will bring you back to home page. 

## Technologies Used

* Redux
* React.js
* MongoDB
* Node.js
